## Introduction
This project leverages the power of Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze a custom image of the moon in the frequency domain. By converting the image from the spatial domain to the frequency domain, we can explore the frequency components and gain insights into the image's structure and patterns.

## Features
- **Custom Moon Image:** The image used in this project was captured using a Celestron Astromaster 70EQ telescope by me. 
- **Fourier Transform:** Applied FFT to convert the image from the spatial domain to the frequency domain.
- **Visualization:** Visualized the magnitude spectrum of the transformed image to observe the frequency components.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, AstroPy, PIL

## Image Details
- **Image Source:** Custom photograph of the moon taken using a Celestron Astromaster 70EQ telescope.
- **Format:** The image was processed and saved in a high-resolution format for analysis.

## Fourier Transform
The Fourier Transform was applied to the image using the FFT algorithm to transform the spatial domain image into its frequency domain representation. The magnitude spectrum of the FFT was then computed to visualize the frequency components.

## Results
The frequency analysis revealed various patterns and structures within the moon image, highlighting the high-frequency components corresponding to the edges and finer details. The magnitude spectrum provided a clear visualization of these components, offering insights into the image's underlying structure.
